# Write a function that goes through any 2D list and finds the largest and smallest number in that list
# THEN switches thier position 



# Write a function that goes through a 2D list, list by list

# so from two[0],two[1].... etc.. use a while loop to parse list by list
# for every loop, I want you to ask the user to input a number, whatever number the user inputs, append that number to the list
# then move on to the following list


# for example : 




two = [[1,2,44,6,7],[1,2,4,56],[3,4,56,444,62]]
print("hello user, what number would you like to add?")
num = input()
two[0].append(num)


# BUT do this in a while loop so that instead of Two[0].append, we have Two[count].append
count = 0
secondcount = 0
smallest_position_first_square = count
smallest_position_sec_square = secondcount
